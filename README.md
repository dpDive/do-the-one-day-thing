Welcome to the Exercise


## Notes

Computer Science and Software Engineering are evergreen and ever-changing fields.

New concepts, frameworks, tools will appear in the future. This class cannot travel forward in time to learn future content.

If you become able to learn new concepts independently outside of class, it means that we have succeeded.
